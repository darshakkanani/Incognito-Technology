# Security & Compliance Framework

## Overview
Incognito Technology implements comprehensive security measures and compliance frameworks to protect healthcare data and ensure regulatory adherence.

## Compliance Standards

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **Administrative Safeguards**: Security officer, workforce training, access management
- **Physical Safeguards**: Facility access controls, workstation use restrictions
- **Technical Safeguards**: Access control, audit controls, integrity, transmission security

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Data Protection Principles**: Lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation
- **Individual Rights**: Access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection
- **Privacy by Design**: Data protection integrated into system design

### ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)
- **ISMS Implementation**: Systematic approach to managing sensitive information
- **Risk Management**: Continuous risk assessment and mitigation
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular audits and updates

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
```
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
├── Primary Factor: Username/Password
├── Secondary Factor: SMS/TOTP/Hardware Token
└── Biometric Factor: Fingerprint/Face Recognition (optional)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
├── Super Admin: Full system access
├── Hospital Admin: Organization-wide access
├── Doctor: Patient data access
├── Nurse: Limited patient data access
├── Patient: Own records only
└── Auditor: Audit logs access
```

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for all databases and file storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Additional encryption for sensitive PHI fields
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key storage

### Network Security
- **Firewall Rules**: Default deny-all with whitelist approach
- **Network Segmentation**: DMZ, application tier, database tier separation
- **VPN Access**: Certificate-based authentication for remote access
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting and traffic analysis

## Data Classification

### Public Data
- Marketing materials
- Public documentation
- General company information

### Internal Data
- Business processes
- Non-sensitive operational data
- Internal communications

### Confidential Data
- Patient health information (PHI)
- Financial records
- Proprietary algorithms
- Business strategies

### Restricted Data
- Authentication credentials
- Encryption keys
- Audit logs
- Security configurations

## Incident Response Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation
- Incident response team formation
- Communication plans
- Tool and resource preparation
- Training and awareness

### Phase 2: Detection & Analysis
- Security monitoring and alerting
- Incident classification and prioritization
- Evidence collection and preservation
- Initial impact assessment

### Phase 3: Containment & Eradication
- Immediate containment actions
- System isolation if necessary
- Threat removal and system cleaning
- Vulnerability patching

### Phase 4: Recovery & Lessons Learned
- System restoration and monitoring
- Business operations resumption
- Post-incident analysis
- Process improvements

## Audit & Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring
- **SIEM Integration**: Real-time security event correlation
- **Log Analysis**: Automated log parsing and alerting
- **Behavioral Analytics**: User and entity behavior monitoring
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular automated security scans

### Audit Requirements
- **Access Logs**: All data access logged with user, time, and purpose
- **Change Logs**: All system changes tracked and approved
- **Compliance Audits**: Regular internal and external audits
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessments

## Privacy Controls

### Data Minimization
- Collect only necessary data
- Regular data purging policies
- Purpose limitation enforcement
- Storage limitation compliance

### Consent Management
- Granular consent options
- Consent withdrawal mechanisms
- Consent audit trails
- Regular consent reviews

### Data Subject Rights
- **Right to Access**: Automated data export functionality
- **Right to Rectification**: Self-service data correction
- **Right to Erasure**: Automated data deletion with audit trail
- **Right to Portability**: Standardized data export formats

## Security Testing

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Tools**: SonarQube, Semgrep, Bandit
- **Frequency**: Every code commit
- **Coverage**: All source code repositories

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- **Frequency**: Weekly automated scans
- **Scope**: All web applications and APIs

### Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
- **Tools**: Contrast Security, Checkmarx
- **Integration**: Runtime security monitoring
- **Coverage**: Production and staging environments

### Penetration Testing
- **Frequency**: Quarterly internal, Annual external
- **Scope**: Full infrastructure and applications
- **Methodology**: OWASP Testing Guide, NIST SP 800-115

## Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Compliance Checks
- **HIPAA Controls**: Automated verification of technical safeguards
- **GDPR Requirements**: Data processing activity monitoring
- **ISO 27001**: Control effectiveness measurement

### Compliance Reporting
- **Monthly Reports**: Security metrics and KPIs
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Compliance status assessment
- **Annual Audits**: Comprehensive compliance evaluation

### Risk Assessment
- **Methodology**: NIST Risk Management Framework
- **Frequency**: Annual comprehensive, Quarterly updates
- **Scope**: Technical, operational, and management controls
