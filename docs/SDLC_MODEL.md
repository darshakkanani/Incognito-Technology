# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model

## Overview

Incognito Technology follows an Agile DevSecOps methodology with security-first development practices and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Development Methodology

### Agile Framework
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Team Structure**: Cross-functional teams with developers, security engineers, and QA
- **Ceremonies**: Daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, demos

### DevSecOps Integration
- Security integrated from day one
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Continuous monitoring and feedback

## Development Phases

### 1. Planning & Requirements
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - Stakeholder requirements gathering
  - Security requirements analysis
  - Compliance requirements (HIPAA, GDPR)
  - Technical architecture design
  - Risk assessment

### 2. Design & Architecture
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - System architecture design
  - Security architecture review
  - Database schema design
  - API design and documentation
  - UI/UX wireframes and prototypes

### 3. Development
- **Duration**: 6-8 weeks (iterative)
- **Activities**:
  - Feature development in sprints
  - Code reviews and pair programming
  - Unit testing (TDD approach)
  - Security code analysis (SAST)
  - Documentation updates

### 4. Testing
- **Duration**: Continuous throughout development
- **Activities**:
  - Automated unit testing
  - Integration testing
  - Security testing (DAST, IAST)
  - Performance testing
  - Compliance testing

### 5. Deployment
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Activities**:
  - Automated CI/CD pipeline
  - Infrastructure provisioning
  - Blue-green deployments
  - Monitoring and alerting setup
  - Rollback procedures

### 6. Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Duration**: Ongoing
- **Activities**:
  - Performance monitoring
  - Security monitoring
  - Bug fixes and patches
  - Feature enhancements
  - Compliance audits

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
```yaml
Triggers: Push to main/develop branches, Pull requests
Steps:
  1. Code checkout
  2. Dependency installation
  3. Linting and formatting
  4. Unit tests
  5. Security scans
  6. Build artifacts
  7. Integration tests
  8. Quality gates
```

### Continuous Deployment
```yaml
Environments: Development → Staging → Production
Steps:
  1. Artifact deployment
  2. Database migrations
  3. Health checks
  4. Smoke tests
  5. Monitoring setup
  6. Rollback on failure
```

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory for all changes
- **Static Analysis**: SonarQube, ESLint, Pylint
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and API documentation

### Security Quality
- **SAST Tools**: Semgrep, Bandit, ESLint Security
- **DAST Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk, npm audit, safety
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Clair
