## 2. Access Control

### 2.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```
Super Admin -> Full system access
Hospital Admin -> Organization-wide patient data
Doctor -> Assigned patient data + AI tools
Nurse -> Basic patient data + care notes
Patient -> Own medical records only
Researcher -> Anonymized data only
Auditor -> Audit logs and compliance reports
```

### 2.2 Authentication Requirements
- Minimum 12-character passwords with complexity requirements
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) mandatory for all users
- Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
- Maximum 3 failed login attempts before account lockout

### 2.3 Authorization Principles
- Principle of least privilege
- Need-to-know basis for data access
- Regular access reviews (quarterly)
- Automatic deprovisioning upon role change/termination

## 3. Data Protection

### 3.1 Encryption Standards
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all databases and file storage
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications

### 6.2 Response Timeline
- **P1**: 15 minutes detection, 1 hour containment, 4 hours resolution
- **P2**: 1 hour detection, 4 hours containment, 24 hours resolution

- **P4**: 24 hours detection, 1 week resolution

### 6.3 Breach Notification
- Internal notification: Within 1 hour of discovery
